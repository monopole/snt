# Kubernetes Configuration

A tutorial for kubernetes configuration.

STATUS: under development Oct 2017

Content from [github.com/monopole/snt](http://github.com/monopole/snt).

The full path through the tutorial is a depth first
traversal of the content tree.

Instructions: open a terminal and copy/paste command
blocks to it as you read, starting with the following
block:

<!-- @makeTutorialWorkingDirectory-->
```
TUT_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
```
All file writing - software installation, source code
and data file creation - will happen in that disposable
directory.
