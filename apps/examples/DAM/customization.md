# First order customization

The bulk of the fields in the manifest exist
to support resource customization.

This is _first order_ customization since it directly
modifies `Kube-manifest.yaml` _forking it_ from its
original version.

## Names

The simplest form of customization is to change
resource names.  In DAM, this is done by adding a
prefix.

Be sure the manifest is in original form:
<!-- @resetManifest @test -->
```
cp $TUT_ORG_MANIFEST $TUT_DAM_MANIFEST
```

Add a _namePrefix_ specification to the manifest:
<!-- @addNamePrefix @test -->
```
echo "namePrefix: acme-" >> $TUT_DAM_MANIFEST
```

Run `kinflate`:

<!-- @runKinflate @test -->
```
kinflate inflate -f $TUT_DAM >$TUT_TMP/customized_out
```

Compare the differences to see the effect:

<!-- @checkDiffs @test -->
```
diff $TUT_TMP/original_out $TUT_TMP/customized_out
```

## Labels and annotations

Without further ado:

<!-- @addLabelsAndAnnotations @test -->
```
cat <<'EOF' >> $TUT_DAM_MANIFEST
objectLabels:
  app: acmehello
  org: acme-corporation
objectAnnotations:
  note: Generated by a tutorial.
EOF
```

<!-- @runKinflateAgain @test -->
```
kinflate inflate -f $TUT_DAM >$TUT_TMP/customized_out
```

<!-- @checkDiffsAgain @test -->
```
diff $TUT_TMP/original_out $TUT_TMP/customized_out
```

At this point, an end user could check the manifest and
its resources into her version control repository.

It becomes her own version of the _app_.

She can capture upgrades (manifest and resource
changes) by rebasing from the original.

The use case here is multiple users working in the same
cluster using the same app, naturally wanting to keep
their apps distinct.
