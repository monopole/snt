# Eschew Changing ConfigMaps

> _Optional section: Change a configmap to see why its not a good thing._

Apply a change to `cfg-french` that changes the greeting:

<!-- @applyMapChange @test -->
```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cfg-french
data:
  altGreeting: "Bienvenue"
  enableRisky: "false"
EOF
```

<!-- @descConfigMap @test -->
```
kubectl describe configmap cfg-french
```

A query shows that `tuthello` is still using
_Bonjour_:

<!-- @curlService @test -->
```
tut_query svc-eggplant lemon | grep Bonjour
```

### Mixed states

Define function to delete a random pod:

<!-- @funcDelRandomPod @env @test -->
```
function tut_deleteRandomPod {
  local tmpl=`cat <<EOF
{{range .items -}}
{{.metadata.name}}
{{end}}
EOF
`
  local victim=$(\
      kubectl get -o go-template="$tmpl" pods |\
      sort -R | head -n 1)
  kubectl delete pod $victim
}
```

Delete one pod at a time and watch as new configuration
is adopted by new pods.

<!-- @deleteOnePod @test -->
```
tut_deleteRandomPod
sleep 2
```

Repeat this query enough times to hit all pods
shows emit both a _Bonjour_ and a _Bienvenue_:

<!-- @tryQuery  -->
```
tut_query svc-eggplant orange
```

The cluster can be placed in an undesirable mixed state
by changing the config and deleting a single pod.

Get everything in sync again by deleting all the pods
to force recreation at the latest config:

<!-- @deleteAllPods @test -->
```
kubectl delete --all pods
```

Confirm the new greeting _Bienvenue_ is always served:
<!-- @tryQuery @test -->
```
tut_query svc-eggplant orange
```

The point is of the section is to recall that pods can
come and go at any time, and thereâ€™s no way to know
which version of the map was in force when the pod was
created.
